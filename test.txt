Wikis are enabled by wiki software, otherwise known as wiki engines. 
A wiki engine, being a form of a content management system, differs from
other web-based systems such as blog software, in that the content is created wi
thout any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little inherent structure, allowing structure 
to emerge according to the needs of the users.[1] Wiki engines usually allow content to be written usin
g a simplified markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor.[2] There are dozens of diffe
rent wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are 
open-source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example, editi
ng rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Oth
er rules may be imposed to organize content.
